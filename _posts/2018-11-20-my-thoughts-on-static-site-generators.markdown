### What do you think of static site generators?

When you have learnt the SSG, in this case Jekyll. It makes the production of static sites gets less complicated & faster. The use of includes & variables makes the navigation a breeze compared to not using an SSG. In the final project of 1DV504 we produced a website with multiple pages & navigations.I reckon that with the use of an SSG i would have cut down the production time of at least 50%.

### Whath type of projects are they suitable for?

Smaller projects with few users. Blogs are the typical use case, but it can be used for almost everything. You could even use it with a back end service to provide dynamic content & easier content management. But by then I think the advantages of using SSGs are to small to not go with another framework. 

Blogs, projects overview, documentation and maybe even mockups would be a great purpose for an SSG. But only if the user has knowledge in web development.
